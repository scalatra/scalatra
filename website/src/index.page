# Scalatra = Scala + Sinatra

<dfn>Scalatra</dfn> is a tiny, [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)-like web
framework for [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/).  

## Why Scalatra?

- *Lightweight*: Scalatra is not a full application stack.  It is a simple DSL
  for dispatching HTTP requests to Scala code blocks.  The rest of your
  architecture remains up to you.

- *Scalable*: Scalatra will grow with your application from a single-file
  prototype to a multi-tier enterprise application.

- *Familiar*: [Similar DSLs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinatra_%28software%29#Sinatra_inspired_frameworks)
  exist in many other languages.  Scalatra is a very comfortable way for users
  of those frameworks to explore the power of Scala.

- *Java-interoperable*: Scalatra can call your existing Java libraries and
  deploys to your favorite servlet container.  Migrate from Java at your own
  pace.

- *Vibrant*: Scalatra has an active [community](community.html) of users and
  contributors.  Come join us.

## Example

    import org.scalatra._

    // This Scalatra application is a simple servlet.
    class ScalatraExample extends ScalatraServlet {

      // A Scalatra application is made up of routes.  A route is an HTTP
      // method (e.g., GET, POST), a path pattern, and an action block to
      // execute if the route matches.
      //
      // This route matches GET requests to /hello/name, where name is a path
      // parameter.
      get("/hello/:name") {
        // The name parameter is available in the params map.
        val name = params("name")

        // You can do business logic inline or call out to your business tier.
        // Scalatra leaves these architectural decisions to you.
        val nameUpper = name.toUpperCase

        // You have full access to the Servlet API.
        response.setHeader("X-Powered-By", "Scalatra")

        // Like any good MVC framework, Scalatra allows you to separate the
        // logic from the view by calling out to a templating system such
        // as Scalate.
        //
        // Alternatively, Scalatra will render the return type of the action
        // block.  In the case of an XML literal, a content-type of "text/html"
        // is inferred, and the XML is rendered back to the response.  This
        // rendering is completely customizable.
        <h1>Hello, {nameUpper}!</h1>
      }
    }
