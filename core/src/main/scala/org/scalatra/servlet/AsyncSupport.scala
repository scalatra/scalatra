  /**
   * The Scalatra DSL core methods take a list of [[org.scalatra.RouteMatcher]]
   * and a block as the action body.  The return value of the block is
   * rendered through the pipeline and sent to the client as the response body.
   * The block of these methods is executed in a lightweight event-driven thread
   * from Akka's dispatchers
   *
   * See [[org.scalatra.ScalatraBase#renderResponseBody]] for the detailed
   * behaviour and how to handle your response body more explicitly, and see
   * how different return types are handled.
   *
   * The block is executed in the context of a CoreDsl instance, so all the
   * methods defined in this trait are also available inside the block.
   *

   *   asyncGet("/") {
